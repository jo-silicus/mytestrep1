<P>This graph shows you have a good balance between all three content areas. 
Learning and processing of information should come easily to you because you can 
handle information in most any manner in which it is presented. Typically a 
person with this type of balance will do well in group situations: such 
individuals can adapt to whatever content the group prefers. They will also do 
well in progressing from one business function or team to another because they 
have the ability to adapt quickly to a new situation or subject that might 
require operations in a particular content format, (i.e. numbers, text, 
designs). You seem to be able to operate well in all content 
areas.</P></BODY></HTML>
