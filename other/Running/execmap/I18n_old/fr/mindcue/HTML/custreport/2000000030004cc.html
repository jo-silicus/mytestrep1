<p> This graph shows that you have a decided tendency towards figural information as opposed to the other two contents.  While this fact alone does not give the whole picture in terms of the ways you process information, it does indicate that you prefer a more real life approach to learning and development.  You seem to prefer learning through experience.  Rather than interpreting a sentence or reading passage, you would prefer to experience the situation so you can see it, feel it, and touch it.  Movies, television, or actual experiences are your prime methods of understanding in this content. In academia,  material is rarely taught in this fashion. </p><p> Operating a business that requires a good feel for balance, perspective and proportion, such as construction, cabinet-making, civil engineering, graphic design etc. are examples of roles that require a high degree of figural content.  In terms of management style, you probably find yourself more of a hands-on  manager, willing to get right in with subordinates in a &quot;shirt sleeves&quot;  approach.  Depending upon the type of business, this can be quite effective for you.  The only thing to watch out for is the tendency to  &quot;micro-manage&quot; because you will want to get right in there and do the job yourself.</p>
