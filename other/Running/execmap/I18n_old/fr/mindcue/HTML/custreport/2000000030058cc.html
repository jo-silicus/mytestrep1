Certainly, to reach this level in your career, you must read quite well. So, the report is focused  more towards your style of reading.  It looks at your ability to digest very complex technical material as well as your ability to <i> read between the lines.</i>  It gives you a good idea as to whether you are retaining the material you read or whether you selectively retain information</p>  <p> In addition, the report will also look at your ability to handle arithmetic and mathematics.  Again, the report knows you can perform these functions, but it analyzes whether you are confortable in dealing with numbers or would prefer someone else do the laborious functions of adding columns of data.  Quite often, at this level and with the advent of computers, we simply don't do much <i>arithmetic </I> manually, so we may be more prone to simple mistakes like changing a sign or dropping a decimal point.  The report will give you a good feel as to your accuracy in these areas.  The mathematics section gives you a good feel on how you deal with the third dimension and situations that require design, layout, proportion and balance.</b></font>  </p>
