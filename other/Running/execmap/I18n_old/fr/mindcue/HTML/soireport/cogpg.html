<p><b>C** </b>stands for <b>Cognition. </b>It means the same as comprehension or
understanding and is the basic ability to receive and process information. It is immediate
discovery, awareness, rediscovery, or recognition of information in any form. The same as

<p>Stanine 6 and above are rapid workers who catch on quickly. They work best at tasks
where there are many things to do, in a variety of ways; otherwise, they are prone to
boredom. Because they &quot;get it&quot; so quickly, they like fast-paced, changing tasks.
They may not wait to hear all of the information before interrupting or turning away to
&quot;get on with it&quot; <font FACE="Symbol">¾</font> which can make them seem
