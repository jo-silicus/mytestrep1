<p><b>N** </b>stands for <b>coNvergent production. </b>For the Mindcue product, we call it
problem-solving. It is the ability to arrive at a determinate answer from given
information. This is one's ability to use information or facts to achieve a defined or
desired outcome. The <b>N** </b>measure is composed of three different Mindcue activities.
</p>

<p>Stanine 6 and above indicates academic potential and is usually associated with high
grades in school and college, and with research and scholarship. High <b>N**</b> also
reflects general working skills and production abilities. The person who can solve
problems where answers are determined by rule-following will like tasks that are
predictable, where work is well documented, and where completion objectives are known
ahead of time. High <b>N** </b>with high <b>D** </b></font><score ; type="skill" ;id="8"><font FACE="Arial">will also
work hard, but prefer tasks that interest them. </p>
</font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">

<p></font><font FACE="Arial">Stanine 3 and below usually do not have good work skills, nor
will they stick with subject matter that they deem as tedious. Low <b>N**</b> may stem
from low <b>M** </b></font><score ; type="skill" ; id="5"><font FACE="Arial"> . They are not skillful in situations where
they must adjust existing rules to new circumstances. Requiring varied motivation
programs, they can be encouraged by behavior modification systems.</p>
