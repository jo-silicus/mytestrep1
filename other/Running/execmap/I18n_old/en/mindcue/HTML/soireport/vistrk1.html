<P>Visual sequencing as represented by MSSv is low and indicates the student may be having problems processing a sequence of visual stimuli.  You might notice the student forgetting passages and having to reread sentences or paragraphs to make sense of what is being read.  To determine if vision therapy is required, we recommend you contact a Developmental Optometrist for further evaluation.</P>
