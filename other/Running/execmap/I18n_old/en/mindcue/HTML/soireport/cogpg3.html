<p>C** </b>stands for <b>Cognition. </b>It means the same as comprehension or
understanding and is the basic ability to receive and process information. It is immediate
discovery, awareness, rediscovery, or recognition of information in any form. The same as
the &quot;Eureka! Experience represented in cartoons with a light bulb over a person's
head, it is critical for understanding and following routines, directions, and
instructions. The C score measures a composite of nine different MindCue activities.</p>

<p>Stanine 6 and above are rapid workers who catch on quickly. They work best at tasks
where there are many things to do, in a variety of ways; otherwise, they are prone to
boredom. Because they &quot;get it&quot; so quickly, they like fast-paced, changing tasks.
They may not wait to hear all of the information before interrupting or turning away to
&quot;get on with it&quot; <font FACE="Symbol"></font> which can make them seem
impulsive, or even rude, to people with lower cognition abilities. Without an equally high

<p>Stanine 5 or below need to hear and see instructions frequently and repeatedly when

<p>Stanine 3 and below requires a patient supervisor or instructor who can give
structured, repetitive tasks where the routine does not change frequently or the mode of
operation remains constant. </p>
