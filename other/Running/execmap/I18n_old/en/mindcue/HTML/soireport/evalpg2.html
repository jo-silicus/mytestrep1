<p ALIGN="CENTER">Decision Making (Evaluation)</p>
</font><font FACE="Arial">

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><b>E** </b>is for Evaluation or Decision-making. This is judgement, the
ability to decide, and foresight. It is comparison and contrast, deciding likenesses and
differences. <b>E** </b>is required in situations that involve reasoning one's way through
incomplete information, whether ambiguity or uncertainty. It deals primarily with the
practical side of life. Unfortunately, it is difficult to teach in a classroom, so
schooling usually does not nurture or build <b>E** </b>abilities as much as would be
desirable. The <b>E**</b> measure is a composite of five different MindCue activities.<br>
</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">E**</b> abilities are normally not fully developed until one approaches
adulthood. Accordingly, it should not be alarming if young people do not score high in
this area. Further, it is not hard to acknowledge and understand the sometime irrational
behavior of some teenagers when this fact is taken into account.</p>

<p>Stanine 6 and above are the people who take responsibility, plan efficiently, and make
good decisions. High <b>E**</b> people tend to make judgements for other people. They
typically want to be in control, are often leaders, and they like to organize and
strategize. Supervisors, foremen, administrators, and executives generally score well in <b>E**
</b>abilities. However, when the high <b>E**</b> become managers, their keen sensitivity
to nuances (especially when <b>C**</b></font><score;type="skill";id="4"><font FACE="Arial"> is also high) may make
them too sensitive and even vulnerable to manipulation by others.</p>

<p>Stanine 3 or below are often &quot;in trouble&quot; because they make wrong decisions
and are poor planners. They often freeze when faced by ambiguous or uncertain information.
Until middle-aged or so (when physical aging may seem to show &quot;wisdom&quot;), they
may be considered immature because they do not know how to make decisions. </p>
