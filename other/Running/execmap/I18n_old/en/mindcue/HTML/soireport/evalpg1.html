<p ALIGN="CENTER">Decision Making (Evaluation)</p>
</font><font FACE="Arial">

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><b>E** </b>is for<b> Evaluation or Decision-making. </b>This is
judgement, the ability to decide, and foresight. It is comparison and contrast, deciding
likenesses and differences. <strong>E**</strong> is required in situations that involve
reasoning one's way through incomplete information, whether ambiguity or uncertainty. It
deals primarily with the practical side of life. Unfortunately, it is difficult to teach
in a classroom, so schooling usually does not nurture or build <strong>E**</strong>
abilities as much as would be desirable. The<strong> E**</strong> measure is a composite
of five different MindCue activities. <br>
</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">E** abilities are normally not fully developed until one approaches
adulthood. Accordingly, it should not be alarming if young people do not score high in
this area. Further, it is not hard to acknowledge and understand the sometime irrational
behavior of some teenagers when this fact is taken into account. </p>

<p>Stanine 6 and above are the people who take responsibility, plan efficiently, and make
good decisions. High <strong>E**</strong> people tend to make judgements for other people.
They typically want to be in control, are often leaders, and they like to organize and
strategize. Supervisors, foremen, administrators, and executives generally score well in <strong>E**</strong>
abilities. However, when the high<strong> E**</strong> become managers, their keen
sensitivity to nuances (especially when <strong>C**</strong></font><score;type="skill";id="4"><font FACE="Arial"> is
also high) may make them too sensitive and even vulnerable to manipulation by others.</p>

<p>Stanine 3 or below are often &quot;in trouble&quot; because they make wrong decisions
and are poor planners. They often freeze when faced by ambiguous or uncertain information.
Until middle-aged or so (when physical aging may seem to show &quot;wisdom&quot;), they
may be considered immature because they do not know how to make decisions. </p>
