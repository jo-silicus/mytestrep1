<FONT SIZE=2><p> &#9;</FONT>You appear to have an unusually high ability to understand material that is presented in semantic terms.  Since most material taught in school is semantic in nature, you have probably been a successful student.  Concepts and lessons that are presented via stories, text, etc.  are ones that are most effective for you.  Further , you are most likely to respond with lengthy stories, written papers, and reports carefully outlining the detail of the subject at hand.  You also probably find that you work well on your own, because you can read and understand at your own pace and are not dependent upon others to get the information.  </p>
