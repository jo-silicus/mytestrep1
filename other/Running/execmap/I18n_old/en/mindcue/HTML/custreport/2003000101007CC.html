<p> Analyzing each content in depth shows you have a strong ability to handle figural material.  Typically, this is the first ability to develop after birth.  You have retained a  definite strength, and should do well in activities  involving spatial orientation such as crafts and athletics.  You should also do well with experiential learning such as field trips, experiments, and  recreation centers.  Unfortunately most of what is  taught in schools  is not presented in a figural manner.  So if you do not have comparable strength in either the symbolic or semantic areas, you may have had  difficulty in school.  This results because most information being presented to you is being taught in a method you are not suited to.  It would be like making a left handed person play sports right handed.  You can do it, but it is hard.  As your education progresses, you should try to develop your other abilities through development exercises.  It will be well worth your effort. </p>
