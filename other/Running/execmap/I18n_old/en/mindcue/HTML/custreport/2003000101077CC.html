</b></u><p> &#9;On balance, you appear to be more numerically oriented.  This would indicate that you  have no trouble in arithmetic operations such as adding and subtracting.  You possess a  solid base upon which to build greater understanding of more complex mathematical concepts and operations.  In testing, we would expect you to be less prone to simple adding/subtracting errors than other students.  Although you may have found algebra and geometry challenging initially, your  numeracy is a good foundation for your ability in those advanced subjects.  If you do well with numbers, but seem to do poorly with geometry and trigonometry, try to get the concepts down into a numerical format where your strength lies. </p>
