<p> Analyzing each content in depth shows your ability to handle figural information is undeveloped.  Since most early schooling emphasizes the other two content areas,  this under-development will probably not cause you  problems in school.  This score would also indicate a lack of spatial awareness and orientation that may cause poor performance in athletics, crafts, perspective, and balance.  You may also find  yourself having problems learning complex math subjects  such as algebra, geometry, or trigonometry.  This is due to your under developed figural ability.  You can build this ability with developmental exercises. It would be well worth your time.   </p>
