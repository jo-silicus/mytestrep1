<FONT SIZE=2><p> &#9;</FONT>You appear to have a very good ability to understand things that are presentedin a symbolic or coded fashion.  Arithmetic and music are both subjects where the material comes to you in symbolic form, and you probably do quite well in these subjects.  The phonetic approach to reading is another example of how symbolic material is used to teach, and you probably found this method to have been easiest.  Now, you are probably finding algebra  easy to learn because it is a subject where substitution of symbology is a key concept and method of expression.  You do best when things are presented in short formula-type fashion, rather than reading long paragraphs about a subject. </p>
