<p> &#9;Your scores  show that you are very attuned to detail in your approach to information and learning.  You are quick to note the finest detail in a subject, situation, or job.  And you do well with things that require careful attention to detail.  You might find that this slows you down somewhat.  Because attention to detail is so important to you, you want to make sure you understand the entire situation  before you make a move.  Talents such as this are particularly useful in jobs where precision is required like machinist, accountant, electrician, programmer,a and so forth.</p>
