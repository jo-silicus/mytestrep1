<B><p> &#9;</B>Your ability in problem solving is in the expected range, indicating a good logical mind.  The exercises given during this assessment show you have a structured approach to facing a problem, and that you can carefully assemble the information needed to solve it.  You will most likely do well with  numerical information where rules, formula, and structure are emphasized.  If you have difficulty dealing with word problems, the fault may be in  your ability to identify information rather than in your understanding of how to solve the problem.</p>
