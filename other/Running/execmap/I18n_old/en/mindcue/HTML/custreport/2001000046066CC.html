</b></u><p> &#9;Reading Concept Use deals with the ability to read, understand, and apply what has been read to a learning or problem solving situation.  Reading comprehension is certainly a part of reading concept use, but it goes further.  It measures the ability to relate written words, thoughts, and paragraphs.  It also considers reading speed and word recognition.  In essence, reading concept use measures how we use reading as an intellectual tool.</p>
