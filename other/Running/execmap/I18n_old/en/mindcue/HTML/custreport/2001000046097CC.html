<p> A trait that appears in your scores is a combination of cognition and decision making scores.  It  indicates you are a very efficient and rapid learner.  The score shows you easily pick up concepts and rapidly assimilate knowledge.  Sometimes this may be frustrating to your friends because this type of person often acknowledges comprehension verbally and wants to proceed to the next point with little or no regard to  other people in  a group.   The point here is to understand that your brain is working faster than most ,and that you have to give other people time to pick up what is very easy for you to understand.</p>
