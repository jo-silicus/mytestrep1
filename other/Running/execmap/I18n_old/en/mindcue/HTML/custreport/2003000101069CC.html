<p> &#9;Your assessment shows you are underdeveloped in reading concept use.  Typically, this means you have the ability to recognize words and translate them into meaning and sounds, but you do not digest the meaning.  You might find that you can read aloud quite well, but when you are asked what was meant by the passage or to recall facts about the reading passage, it is difficult for you to answer.  Look for low scores in your cognition area.  Low scores in this area might indicate you are reading okay, but have difficulty understanding what is being said.  Focus development on comprehension exercises by reading for pleasure, and then describing what you have read to a friend or parent. </p>
