<FONT SIZE=2><p> &#9;</FONT>These memory scores also indicate a particularly high score in memorizing at the unit level.  This indicates you have a good attention span and are intrigued by detail.  Such scoring usually indicates you give care to your schoolwork and you are careful when taking objective type tests.  On the other hand, the scores also indicate that your ability to remember concepts is relatively lower than the detail.  This means you can remember isolated facts about an incident or story, but usually have trouble in giving a good account of the overall concept or plot.  </p>
