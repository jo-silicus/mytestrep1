<FONT SIZE=2><p> &#9;</FONT>The memory scores revealed during this assessment indicate you are an auditory learner.  While this fact is neither good nor bad, certain strategies might be useful in helping you to learn.  Clearly, you must sit in class so you can clearly hear the teacher.  Second, try to keep distractions to a minimum because you must focus your total attention on the speaker.  Information given orally is  rarely repeated, and thus it must be retained the first time through.  If you are distracted while something important  is being addressed, an opportunity for learning is lost. You should also find a  short way of taking notes, because you want to spend minimum time   writing and more time listening.  </p>
