<FONT SIZE=2><p> &#9;</FONT>These memory scores also indicate a somewhat low score in memorizing at the unit level.  This usually indicates you are not particularly concerned with detail and the attention you give to such work might be careless.  Students exhibiting this type of ability usually have difficulty with objective type testing because they are usually careless with their answers and often make simple mistakes in selecting the wrong response.  On the other hand, your ability to remember concepts and systems of information is relatively high.  This would indicate you have a much better chance of understanding the concept as opposed to the details surrounding it.    </p>
