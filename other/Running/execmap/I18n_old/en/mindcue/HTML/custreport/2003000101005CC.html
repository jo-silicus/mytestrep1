<p> This graph shows that you have a decided tendency towards symbolic information as opposed to the other two contents.  While this fact alone does not give the whole picture in terms of learning style, it does indicate that you prefer a notational style of learning.  Brevity, bullets, and symbolic notations are your strengths.  Thus, in areas where this type of information is prevalent, such as math, music, maps, and acronyms, you will do quite well.  You are really well suited to occupations that focus on numbers and symbols.  Jobs like accountancy, engineering, computer technician and programmer, musician, etc. are excellent examples of ones that stress symbolic information.</p>
