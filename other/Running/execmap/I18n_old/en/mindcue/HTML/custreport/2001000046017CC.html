<p> As the above graph indicates, your cognition abilities are extremely high.  Undoubtedly, you are very quick to grasp a concept or idea.  Typically, you would be  nodding your head as you receive information. It is a signal that your brain has received the new information and you are ready to proceed to more.    In some cases, you might find yourself stopping a person mid-sentence, parroting back some of the information, as another  indication that you have received the information and are ready to proceed to the next point.  An individual with this level of cognition ability is very perceptive, and will notice and understand nuance.  You may want to watch your actions in a group, however, because people may get  impatient with your speed.  Remember, they might not be understanding the material as fast as you are.  </p>
