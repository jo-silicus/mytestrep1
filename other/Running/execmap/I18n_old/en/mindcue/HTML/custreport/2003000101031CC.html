<FONT SIZE=2><p> &#9;</FONT>Your memory is very good and indicates you have ability in both realms: visual and auditory.  Such a high memory ability will significantly enhance your ability in school, especially in the area of testing where recall of information is so important.  It is also important in learning arithmetic where you must remember  math facts and numerical relationships. Very high memory, however, can lead to laziness in solving problems.  Make sure you always work through a problem instead of just remembering what the answer was from the last time you did this type of problem.  That will help you understand and learn very complex information.  </p>
