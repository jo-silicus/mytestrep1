dmsx.dmsx.questiontext0.questiontext=Sonya, Vice President of Marketing, arrive at the office yesterday and
dmsx.dmsx.questiontext1.questiontext=Jim has always felt that an effective sales presentation includes
dmsx.dmsx.questiontext2.questiontext=Activities such as these are
dmsx.dmsx.choicetext0.choicetext=immediately prepared for the sales conference later that afternoon
dmsx.dmsx.choicetext1.choicetext=found that someone had emptied the contents of her desk
dmsx.dmsx.choicetext2.choicetext=began combing through her E-Mail
dmsx.dmsx.choicetext3.choicetext=noted her secretary had cancelled the first appointment on her schedule
dmsx.dmsx.choicetext4.choicetext=found that she had inadvertently put the TV remote control in her briefcase
dmsx.dmsx.choicetext5.choicetext=a quick slight of hand demonstration to make everyone feel at ease
dmsx.dmsx.choicetext6.choicetext=a summary of the products capabilities and benefits
dmsx.dmsx.choicetext7.choicetext=someone from the mail room
dmsx.dmsx.choicetext8.choicetext=a review of up to date pricing
dmsx.dmsx.choicetext9.choicetext=refreshments served midway through the meeting
dmsx.dmsx.choicetext10.choicetext=difficult to ascertain the real purpose and intent
dmsx.dmsx.choicetext11.choicetext=critical to business success and should be completed in great detail
dmsx.dmsx.choicetext12.choicetext=frustrating because you never know what is expected from you
dmsx.dmsx.choicetext13.choicetext=time consuming and of doubtful value
dmsx.dmsx.choicetext14.choicetext=especially meaningful because it gives me an opportunity to express myself
dmsx.dmsx.subchoicetext0.subchoicetext=Quickly, she began to edit her presentation
dmsx.dmsx.subchoicetext1.subchoicetext=She needed to review last months forecast
dmsx.dmsx.subchoicetext2.subchoicetext=Throwing conscience to the wind, she scheduled a spa appointment for the same time
dmsx.dmsx.subchoicetext3.subchoicetext=She knew the first slide would blow her CEO right out of the water
dmsx.dmsx.subchoicetext4.subchoicetext=She was concerned that she might face difficult questions
dmsx.dmsx.subchoicetext5.subchoicetext=She was thankful her secretary had followed her instructions
dmsx.dmsx.subchoicetext6.subchoicetext=Thinking that she had been fired, she quickly left the building
dmsx.dmsx.subchoicetext7.subchoicetext=Feeling this was odd as she had locked the desk, she called security
dmsx.dmsx.subchoicetext8.subchoicetext=This was a great time to replenish her supplies from the office storeroom
dmsx.dmsx.subchoicetext9.subchoicetext=Relaxed, she noted that the office reorganization was beginning as scheduled
dmsx.dmsx.subchoicetext10.subchoicetext=She was amazed that there were only three new messages in her inbox
dmsx.dmsx.subchoicetext11.subchoicetext=She found the response she had been waiting for
dmsx.dmsx.subchoicetext12.subchoicetext=Quickly, she deleted the non-essential mail and focused on two important messages
dmsx.dmsx.subchoicetext13.subchoicetext=Was overjoyed to see that her outgoing messages has been returned undelivered
dmsx.dmsx.subchoicetext14.subchoicetext=Was relieved to see her credit card number had been published on the company web site
dmsx.dmsx.subchoicetext15.subchoicetext=This would give her time to get in a quick set of tennis
dmsx.dmsx.subchoicetext16.subchoicetext=Unfortunately, the appointment was for her morning zen lesson
dmsx.dmsx.subchoicetext17.subchoicetext=This would give her adequate time to prepare for her conference
dmsx.dmsx.subchoicetext18.subchoicetext=The client may be upset, but it was important that she had time to prepare
dmsx.dmsx.subchoicetext19.subchoicetext=Unfortunately, the client called and she was going to have to put it back on
dmsx.dmsx.subchoicetext20.subchoicetext=It was a clear indication that the stress was starting to get to her
dmsx.dmsx.subchoicetext21.subchoicetext=She quickly pointed it at the TV in her office expecting it to work fine
dmsx.dmsx.subchoicetext22.subchoicetext=She dropped everything and returned home - her son would want to watch TV
dmsx.dmsx.subchoicetext23.subchoicetext=I have to remember to get this into the repair shop today she mused
dmsx.dmsx.subchoicetext24.subchoicetext=She quietly laughed, shrugged her shoulders, and began her preparation for the day ahead
dmsx.dmsx.subchoicetext25.subchoicetext=He had noted that many of his clients enjoyed this
dmsx.dmsx.subchoicetext26.subchoicetext=He really enjoyed performing in front of people
dmsx.dmsx.subchoicetext27.subchoicetext=Still he wondered, maybe this isn't the time
dmsx.dmsx.subchoicetext28.subchoicetext=But this client was very formal, he decided against it
dmsx.dmsx.subchoicetext29.subchoicetext=It was especially funny if you could pick-pocket the client's wallet
dmsx.dmsx.subchoicetext30.subchoicetext=It was very important that you give a clear picture of the product's value
dmsx.dmsx.subchoicetext31.subchoicetext=From there you can show the client how the product fills his requirement
dmsx.dmsx.subchoicetext32.subchoicetext=But then, that always led to questions you just didn't want to answer
dmsx.dmsx.subchoicetext33.subchoicetext=It always helped to have a technical person on hand to explain the details
dmsx.dmsx.subchoicetext34.subchoicetext=This was especially true if the client had purchased the product before
dmsx.dmsx.subchoicetext35.subchoicetext=It demonstrated how personal your company was and how it valued it's people
dmsx.dmsx.subchoicetext36.subchoicetext=You never knew when you would need a person of that caliber
dmsx.dmsx.subchoicetext37.subchoicetext=Having a person ready to get materials or other supplies always helped
dmsx.dmsx.subchoicetext38.subchoicetext=He could easily be dismissed if you didn't need him
dmsx.dmsx.subchoicetext39.subchoicetext=It was a positive motivator for young employees to be included in an important event like this
dmsx.dmsx.subchoicetext40.subchoicetext=This was especially true if you were going to raise your prices
dmsx.dmsx.subchoicetext41.subchoicetext=You should always include the terms of payment also
dmsx.dmsx.subchoicetext42.subchoicetext=It never hurts to be up front and candid with the client
dmsx.dmsx.subchoicetext43.subchoicetext=But never do this before lunch, it always upsets the client's appetite
dmsx.dmsx.subchoicetext44.subchoicetext=Be sure to underscore the value of the product compared to the price
dmsx.dmsx.subchoicetext45.subchoicetext=But you would want to avoid serving gas producing foods
dmsx.dmsx.subchoicetext46.subchoicetext=It always helped reduce tension and establish rapport with the client
dmsx.dmsx.subchoicetext47.subchoicetext=Care should be taken to make sure the service is discreet and does not interrupt the meeting
dmsx.dmsx.subchoicetext48.subchoicetext=Make sure you have variety in your selection to account for individual tastes
dmsx.dmsx.subchoicetext49.subchoicetext=In most cases it is considered acceptable to ask the client to pay for what they consume
dmsx.dmsx.subchoicetext50.subchoicetext=For that reason I question it's value
dmsx.dmsx.subchoicetext51.subchoicetext=Nonetheless, I try to comply with the instructions at all times
dmsx.dmsx.subchoicetext52.subchoicetext=So I just click any answer to complete the problem and get on with it
dmsx.dmsx.subchoicetext53.subchoicetext=But, who cares?  This is just a simple exercise in futility
dmsx.dmsx.subchoicetext54.subchoicetext=But then again, that's what makes this interesting
dmsx.dmsx.subchoicetext55.subchoicetext=This is especially true if you are a mortician
dmsx.dmsx.subchoicetext56.subchoicetext=I can't conceive of an occasion where they would not be considered integral to success
dmsx.dmsx.subchoicetext57.subchoicetext=Even so, they can be frustrating at times
dmsx.dmsx.subchoicetext58.subchoicetext=But even considering their value, I don't have time for this
dmsx.dmsx.subchoicetext59.subchoicetext=It is important to complete the exercise as best I can
dmsx.dmsx.subchoicetext60.subchoicetext=It would be helpful if the instructions were more detailed
dmsx.dmsx.subchoicetext61.subchoicetext=But then again, so is life.  So I had just better complete this thought
dmsx.dmsx.subchoicetext62.subchoicetext=I am normally very cautious about things like this
dmsx.dmsx.subchoicetext63.subchoicetext=I am always afraid people might get the wrong idea from my response
dmsx.dmsx.subchoicetext64.subchoicetext=I just wish the computer would blow up right now and end this exercise
dmsx.dmsx.subchoicetext65.subchoicetext=I also question the validity of these type of evolutions.  They seem so confusing
dmsx.dmsx.subchoicetext66.subchoicetext=Nonetheless, I consider it a great opportunity to participate in any exercise, valuable or not
dmsx.dmsx.subchoicetext67.subchoicetext=Perhaps a shorter, more precise approach would be a better way to go
dmsx.dmsx.subchoicetext68.subchoicetext=I wish I could see the Chairman of the Board doing this
dmsx.dmsx.subchoicetext69.subchoicetext=I suppose however, its only three questions and I can complete it if I try
dmsx.dmsx.subchoicetext70.subchoicetext=I feel any exercise that helps define my style to be of value to me
dmsx.dmsx.subchoicetext71.subchoicetext=I know I can expect laughter when they see my answers
dmsx.dmsx.subchoicetext72.subchoicetext=Perhaps the shortest answer will be the better strategy
dmsx.dmsx.subchoicetext73.subchoicetext=It is important that I provide the best possible perspective of my style
dmsx.dmsx.subchoicetext74.subchoicetext=There is no question that I will receive a bonus when they see my answers
