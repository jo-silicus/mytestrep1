  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The assessment helps to determine objectively how the user performs (and will perform) as a leader.   It does so by understanding the many ways that he (or she) thinks (i.e., <u>how</u> the user is smart).  He (or she) was presented with a variety of brief, timed activities that contain different types of information-and that elicit different responses.  The responses were studied for their patterns to show how he processes information, and to discover his inherent strengths.  By looking at those patterns, preliminary findings can be offered as to the user's relative talents in current and future leadership roles-a range of abilities that might not otherwise readily be apparent to him or to his colleagues.</p><p>The findings reveal strengths that can be considered second nature, and those that likely require more effort.  Based on one of the most established and quantifiable models of cognitive assessment, the findings offer a map for subsequent exploration.   There is no good or bad result.  Relative strengths mean little without being considered in the context of a particular situation.  A "high" score in one area, for instance, might indicate an excessive emphasis on a single approach-which in itself might not be good or bad, depending on the environment in which he will exercise leadership.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Results address how he handles information in three different formats; ability to determine and maintain focus on an overall goal or strategy; and style in decision making, directing, planning, and counseling; and reactions to circumstances having various degrees of structure.

Experiential information concerns information one experiences first hand.  It is information one sees, hears, feels, tastes, or smells. It is the information one uses for balance and acuity  (Some cognitive models call it spatial awareness.)  Notational information is information that is conveyed as a code or symbol: numbers, musical notes, acronyms, drawings, or icons on charts.  Last, there is semantic information or information expressed by words and sentences.  It is information that is subject to interpretation, both from the perspective of the sender and the receiver.  It comes in both written and verbal format.  We are interested not only in each of these areas, but in how they compare.</p><p>The following graph displays the user's overall content abilities:</p><center><table width=640 border=1 bordercolor=#C0C0C0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0><tr><td><table width=640 cellpadding=0>  <tr>    <td width= 98></td>    <td colspan=9 width=538><p align=center><font color=#0000FF>Information Content</font></td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td width=98 nowrap bgcolor=#0080C0><font face=Arial size=2 color=#FFFFFF>Experiential</font></td>    <td colspan=9 width=538 bgcolor=#D3D3D3><hr width=418 size=10 color=#000000 align=left noshade>    </td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td width=98 nowrap bgcolor=#0080C0><font face=Arial size=2 color=#FFFFFF>Notational</font></td>    <td colspan=9 width=538 bgcolor=#D3D3D3><hr width=178 size=10 color=#000000 align=left noshade>    </td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td width=98 nowrap bgcolor=#0080C0><font face=Arial size=2 color=#FFFFFF>Semantic</font></td>    <td colspan=9 width=538 bgcolor=#D3D3D3><hr width=178 size=10 color=#000000 align=left noshade>    </td>  </tr><tr><td colspan=10 width=638></td></tr><tr><td bgcolor=#008080 width=98><p align=left><font color=#FFFF00>Scale</font></td><td bgcolor=#008080 width=60><p align=right><font color=#FFFF00>1</font></td><td bgcolor=#008080 width=60><p align=right><font color=#FFFF00>2</font></td><td bgcolor=#008080 width=60><p align=right><font color=#FFFF00>3</font></td><td bgcolor=#008080 width=60><p align=right><font color=#FFFF00>4</font></td><td bgcolor=#008080 width=60><p align=right><font color=#FFFF00>5</font></td><td bgcolor=#008080 width=60><p align=right><font color=#FFFF00>6</font></td><td bgcolor=#008080 width=60><p align=right><font color=#FFFF00>7</font></td><td bgcolor=#008080 width=60><p align=right><font color=#FFFF00>8</font></td><td bgcolor=#008080 width=60><p align=right><font color=#FFFF00>9</font></td></tr><tr><td width=632 colspan=10>&nbsp</td></tr><tr><td width=98></td><td bgcolor=#C0C0C0 colspan=3 align=center width=178><strong><font face=Arial size=2>Less favored</font></strong></td><td bgcolor=#C0C0C0 colspan=3 align=center width=178><strong><font face=Arial size=2>Confident</font></strong></td><td bgcolor=#C0C0C0 colspan=3 align=center width=178><strong><font face=Arial size=2>Dominant</font></strong></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></center><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2"><p>This individual shows exceptional strength in dealing with experiential (or figural) information.  This would indicate that he or she has a good understanding of the process and technology being managed.  Such people learn easily by watching and experiencing activities on the floor.  Typically, these executives have a good feel for spatial matters, balance, and proportion.  They are particularly effective in guiding design, layout, and construction projects.</p><p>People who are strong in this content area are normally pragmatic individuals who are adept in dealing with life as it comes.  They enjoy working in a "hands on" environment and are often found mingling with subordinates, working and assisting with the task at hand.</p></font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2"><p>Symbolic or notational type of information does not appear to be this persons favorite content area. Typically, this is information in its most abbreviated form such as codes, formulae, or acronyms and usually indicates the executive is oriented to the quick, bullet-type of approach.  Projects dealing with numbers, arithmetic matters, accounting, and spreadsheets are those that mandate strong skill in the notational area.  This is not to say that this individual cannot perform these tasks, but indicates that it is probably not their favorite thing to do.</p><p>Persons who do not favor the symbolic or notational content are usually not at home with high-tech, computers, E-Mail, and the electronic way of conducting day to day life.  They usually prefer more human interaction.</p></font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2"><p>Lastly, semantic content deals with verbal information.  It is information and process we communicate through written and oral means.  As you can see, this area is not this individual's forte.  They most likely prefer some other content area more.  This does not mean to say they cannot speak or write, but indicates they may be uncomfortable in that environment.  Typically, they are also individuals who may have difficulty understanding nuance and innuendo.  They tend to see the world in a very clear, crisp orientation, not  where one must  "read between the lines" or see "hidden agendas" to effectively deal with the situation.</p><p>Executives who are uncomfortable in this content area usually are not comfortable with public situations such as meetings, conferences, and social events where one must "work the room."  They prefer a more detached method of interaction.</p></font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2"><p>Also significant is that this individual is dominant in one content area.  That usually indicates he or she will conduct business exclusively in that manner.  For example, a person dominant in experiential content is normally prone to micro-manage.  Such people are so interested in the process that they are driven to participate-sometimes to the point of neglecting their managerial role.</p><p>Individuals dominant in the notational area often prefer the quick E-Mail, Instant Message, or Memo approach to communicating.  Fast, decision oriented action is their style.  Of course there are times when careful personal interaction is required.  A strongly notational individual may not particularly be effective in these situations.</p><p>Individuals dominant in semantic content are ones who enjoy human interaction.  They usually like meetings, conversations, and presentations.  The down-side is that they can be garrulous.</p></font><p ALIGN="CENTER"><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="4"><b><u>Memory</u></b></font></p><center><table width=640 border=1 bordercolor=#C0C0C0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0><tr><td><table width=640 cellpadding=0>  <tr>    <td width= 98></td>    <td colspan=9 width=538><p align=center><font color=#0000FF>Memory</font></td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td width=98 nowrap bgcolor=#0080C0><font face=Arial size=2 color=#FFFFFF>Memory</font></td>    <td colspan=9 width=538 bgcolor=#D3D3D3><hr width=538 size=10 color=#000000 align=left noshade>    </td>  </tr><tr><td colspan=10 width=638></td></tr><tr><td bgcolor=#008080 width=98><p align=left><font color=#FFFF00>Scale</font></td><td bgcolor=#008080 width=60><p align=right><font color=#FFFF00>1</font></td><td bgcolor=#008080 width=60><p align=right><font color=#FFFF00>2</font></td><td bgcolor=#008080 width=60><p align=right><font color=#FFFF00>3</font></td><td bgcolor=#008080 width=60><p align=right><font color=#FFFF00>4</font></td><td bgcolor=#008080 width=60><p align=right><font color=#FFFF00>5</font></td><td bgcolor=#008080 width=60><p align=right><font color=#FFFF00>6</font></td><td bgcolor=#008080 width=60><p align=right><font color=#FFFF00>7</font></td><td bgcolor=#008080 width=60><p align=right><font color=#FFFF00>8</font></td><td bgcolor=#008080 width=60><p align=right><font color=#FFFF00>9</font></td></tr><tr><td width=632 colspan=10>&nbsp</td></tr><tr><td width=98></td><td bgcolor=#C0C0C0 colspan=3 align=center width=178><strong><font face=Arial size=2>Relatively Low	</font></strong></td><td bgcolor=#C0C0C0 colspan=3 align=center width=178><strong><font face=Arial size=2>Competent</font></strong></td><td bgcolor=#C0C0C0 colspan=3 align=center width=178><strong><font face=Arial size=2>Strong</font></strong></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></center><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2"><p>Memory is extremely important for most executives because they are faced with a huge amount of diverse information on a daily basis.  The ExecMap assessment analyzes memory from several different perspectives.

He or she knows which information is important and which is not. Relevant information can be recalled and applied as required.   This is important in fast paced operations and industries where time for research is rare.  This executive appears to have the ability to deal in this environment.  Care should be given, however, to not letting a strong memory overshadow the ability to create new solutions (in contrast to repeating previous approaches).</p></font><p style='page-break-before: always'><p ALIGN="CENTER"><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="4"><b><u>Management Approach</u></b></font></p><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2"><p>Cognitive research in the field of multiple intelligences shows that people will perform best in realms that complement their inherent abilities.  Frequently, the scope of those abilities might not always be apparent to them.  Most anyone can be taught to perform a given function-or to behave in a certain manner.  But the person who really excels in that function is one who seems to confront such responsibilities as "second nature."   The military analogy is of a fighter pilot who "wears" his or her plane, in contrast to a similarly experienced pilot who merely flies. The assessment model applied here can help identify the range and depth of those abilities when applied to leadership: it can correlate them to particular responsibilities in order to present a picture of how the user is likely to lead.</p></font><br><p ALIGN="CENTER"><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="4"><b><u><i>Clarity of Purpose</i></u></b></font></p><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2"><p>This area represents the user's ability to envision--to focus on goals and objectives amid competing priorities.

This means the individual thrives on reacting to daily events of a fast paced, ever changing environment.

There is a danger however, in that often long term goals and objectives are not given the careful consideration they deserve and the situation evolves into crisis management.

This is particularly desirable because it shows that he or she can make the necessary choices, but is not so aggressive as to react before thinking the situation through.  This person is often the most respected member of the organization. Subordinates recognize this person's knowledge but also respect the fact that he or she is attuned to the subordinate's time: decisions will not be delayed because of excessive study and consensus building.  Senior management appreciates this person because he or she can be placed in virtually any environment.  His or her decision-making style can be adapted to any circumstance.</p></font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2"><p>Once a decision is made, leaders often have to identify, assemble, and integrate resources in a way that will yield the desired result.  The assessment analyzes this ability by studying how the user deals with relationships, systems, and sequences.  Along the way, it continues to show his talents for expressing ideas and desires in a clear concise manner.</p><p>The user's directing abilities are in balance. Results indicate a determined, but relaxed, way of implementing a plan or strategy.  The user has a sound understanding of the objectives involved, but is also cognizant of the process required to achieve them. He is prepared to encounter disruption and change. He is strong at maintaining a realistic approach to progress-meaning that he has a balance between flexibility and rigidity: a missed schedule or a production emergency is unlikely to derail his ability execute.</p><p>This balanced approach to directing also indicates his agility. He has a keen eye for sequence and procedure, but also an ability to intervene when required.  He is adaptive.  When he sees something going awry, he reacts promptly-but with restraint-to guide the implementation back in the proper direction. This is not someone prone to overreaction.</p></font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2"><p>A leader often confronts situations in which his decision must be based upon incomplete information.  He calls upon memory, logic, and the ability to make implication.  What we think of as "gut feel" or "intuition" implies a final felicity of judgment.  This assessment also considered how much information was available when the user made decisions.  In this case, the results show the individual is aggressive in his or her approach to decision making, even when dealing with partial information.  The assessment clearly indicates that this person was not frustrated or concerned when only partial information was available.  In fast paced situations, this is often required, but in the longer term arena overly fast reaction can lead to inefficient results.</p></font><p style='page-break-before: always'><p ALIGN="CENTER"><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="4"><b><u><i>Leadership Functions</i></u></b></font></p><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2"><p>No matter how senior his (or her) role, how does the user plan, budget, and counsel on a daily basis?

What distinguishes the leader is his strength at anticipating downstream consequences.  The mechanics of planning (such as timing and resource allocation) remain important, but he is the person from whom strategic insight is expected.  How does he integrate tactics with his strategy?</p><p>The user is competent in doing so,  (A "high" score would indicate he might be prone to getting enmeshed in the weeds.)  He has a good feel for the mechanical factors involved, but also a balanced approach to the future.  He is not preoccupied with the future to the extent that he is overly cautious-meaning that a non-aggressive plan might result.  At the same time is not so relaxed that the plan loses precision and becomes too general.  He is able to internalize the apparent uncertainties of scheduling and allocation, while building his plan with acceptable tolerances for change.  He is particularly adept at incorporating change or revision into his procedures.  He understands that strategy evolves, and that an indirect approach might be the critical path.</p></font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2"><p>A key component of leadership, depending on the context, is the ability to exercise personal, one-on-one direction (or "counseling").  Similar abilities come into play whether the situation is a succession, a performance review, a mentoring session, or imposing discipline:  They involve a talent to understand another person's predicament, to stand in his own moccasins, and to communicate intimately with that person.</p><p>The user's results show that he is the compliant range.  While he can certainly offer insight during performance evaluations, personnel discussions, etc.  his approach appears to be more directive in nature.  Typically, persons in this range do not enjoy close personal involvement with their sub-ordinates  and prefer the more detached style of leadership.  They find it difficult to understand the perspective of others and usually rely on their own paradigm to judge the situation.</p><p>In team building evolutions, effectiveness and efficiency will be the focus more than morale or a nurturing environment with this individual.</p></font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2"><p>The results also show his budgeting ability is in the compliant range.  This means he has a working grasp of accounting and related quantitative practices, but is unlikely to enjoy working in this area.  Budgets are produced when called for but they are unlikely to show forethought and insight into future operations.  Typically they are focused on the near term and rarely address or analyze the impact of external influence or market change.  Clearly the roles of CFO or Comptroller would be difficult for this individual.  Certainly, they can perform the task, but not with the enthusiasm and dedication one would want in a role such as this.</p></font><p style='page-break-before: always'><p ALIGN="CENTER"><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="4"><b><u>Versatility</u></b></font></p><center><table width=640 border=1 bordercolor=#C0C0C0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0><tr><td><table width=640 cellpadding=0>  <tr>    <td width= 98></td>    <td colspan=9 width=538><p align=center><font color=#0000FF>Environments</font></td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td width=98 rowspan=2 nowrap bgcolor=#0080C0><font face=Arial size=2 color=#FFFFFF>Perspective</font></td>    <td colspan=9 width=538 bgcolor=#D3D3D3><hr width=418 size=10 color=#000000 align=left noshade>    </td>  </tr><tr><td colspan=9 width=538 bgcolor=#D3D3D3>&nbsp;&nbsp;Tactical . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

This finding indicates a certain level of experience, seniority and maturity. He will be fulfilled by large, important projects in which the outcome will have an enduring affect on the organization or client.  He enjoys a level of unpredictability, but faces it with broad plans that are likely to have wide-ranging impacts.  Such a person is well suited for the highest level of a large organization or, alternatively, as a consultant directly to people with such responsibilities.</p</font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2"><p>"Setting" describes the general working environment in which the user is likely to perform best.  His results show that he is equally at home whether working for small, unstructured companies (where adaptability and flexibility are key) and for large bureaucratic organizations in which form is almost equal to substance.  The small enterprise, however, would have to be one that had significant impact on a wider environment.  Similarly, the user would be equally adept when interacting with counterparts at very different types of customers or vendors, whether General Motors or a high-flying new technology venture.</p></font></BODY></HTML>
