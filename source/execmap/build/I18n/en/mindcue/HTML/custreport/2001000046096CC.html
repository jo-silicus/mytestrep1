<p> One particular aspect of your reading ability is that it appears you may be putting a lot of stress on yourself when you read.  Logic and analytical scores are up, as well as those that indicate vocabulary and word relationship ability. All indicate good reading ability, but comprehension and speed scores are down.  This is indicative of a person who has been raised under a very strict environment where there is little room for error.  The individual has been taught that only high standards are acceptable and he/she is sub-consciously applying that standard to reading.  Accordingly, the student slows the reading process and focuses word by word because they are afraid they will miss a salient point and thus, that would be bad performance.  If this is true for you, try to read for concept understanding vice word for word.  Also, try to increase your reading for pleasure where there is no stress or fear of failure involved.  </p>
