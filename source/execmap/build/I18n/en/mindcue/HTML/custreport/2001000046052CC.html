<FONT SIZE=2><p> &#9;</FONT>Your scores indicate you may be uncomfortable with decision-making and that you  prefer not to make a choice when you can avoid it.  You probably find choice to be a chore and an exercise you would just as soon avoid, if at all possible.  If you find that you are constantly changing your mind during a test, or that your paper has a lot of erasing on it, this is probably a reflection of your low preference for decision-making.   Students who do not like decision making usually do better with essay type tests or oral presentations where they can explain their selections and the reasoning behind them.  </p>
