During the assessment, the individual was presented several different questions, thinking activities, or choices that required some mental processing. The results show which information formats and processes are second nature to the individual and which require effort and work to complete.  These results are then reflected in terms of learning style, academic potential, vocational abilities, and general ability to deal with new and challenging endeavors.</p></font>
