They are presented in stanine format, which is essentially dividing the area under the normal curve into nine sections.  Stanines 4, 5, and 6 represent results that would be expected from a normal person of this age and education level.  Stanines 1, 2, and 3 represent areas of possible under-development, while Stanines 7, 8, and 9 represent areas of real strength.  In analyzing strengths and weaknesses, focus more on the pattern of abilities rather than the actual score.  The pattern will portray the overall mental processing style of the individual.</p><p ALIGN="CENTER">Results</p><br><img><p ALIGN="CENTER">Content Abilities</p><br><p>Figural content deals with information that is presented in as close to real life as possible. There is no interpretation: the recipient experiences the information. Symbolic content is information that is presented in a coded fashion. Symbols, that in and of themselves mean nothing, are presented in a context that conveys information. Lastly, semantic content deals with information that is presented via word on concept approach. One sees a word and immediately associates a concept or vice versa.</p></font>
