<p> &#9;One of things your assessment shows is that you are somewhat under developed in your ability to conceptualize things in your mind.  This is not really a big thing, because it is not a talent required for learning or good job performance.  It does however, give you an indicator that you probably find it hard to describe a concept and have a good idea of what the end product should look like before you actually build it.  Thus, you would probably want to avoid jobs and occupations that call for a lot of designing and forecasting such as architect, civil engineering, weather forecasting, etc.  </p>
