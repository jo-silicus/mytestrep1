</b></u><p> &#9;Reading readiness is a combination of assessment results that looks at the basic abilities that underlie your ability to read.  First, you must see (more importantly, your brain must see).  And we are looking at that ability. Next, you must have some concept of what a word is and how it is used.  Then you must be able to see commonality - nouns and verbs, and what separates them.  All of these abilities make up the score for reading readiness.</p>
