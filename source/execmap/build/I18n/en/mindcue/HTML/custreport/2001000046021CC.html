<FONT SIZE=2><p> &#9;</FONT>Looking at your performance on the assessment, we can see that you have a good eye for detail.  You deal well with single items and can understand them well.  This is normal for your stage in life where you are learning new things everyday and where the examples being shown are single items.  As you grow older, you will increasingly see how all sorts of things relate to each other,  rather than just focusing on the particular items themselves. At first, this may be tricky.  But with time and  practice, you will become quite proficient in dealing with entire systems of information.  </p>
