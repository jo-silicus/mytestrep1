<B><p ALIGN="CENTER">Content Abilities</p></B><p> Mindcue activities can be analyzed in different ways.  They can be analyzed individually and they can be grouped according to clusters.  The first analysis here is in terms of processing mode, which refers to the way you handle different types of information: Figural (Material you can see, touch or experience), Symbolic (like musical notes or math signs and acronyms), and Semantic (words, sentences and paragraphs).  Content processing mode is especially important.  It determines not only your preferred mode for learning or deciding, but it is also important in considering  career opportunities.  These content scores help you understand how you work with various types of information:  what will be easy for you to master and what will be harder for you to confront. Accepting roles that match your strength would mean that you would most likely succeed in that endeavor. </p><p> Figural content deals with information that is presented in as close to real life as possible.  You do not have to interpret what this information means, it is just there and you experience it.  Symbolic content is information that is presented in a coded fashion.  Symbols, that by themselves mean nothing, but take on a special meaning when assigned a context.  It is like a + sign meaning to &quot;add&quot; when you are dealing with arithmetic.  Lastly, semantic content deals with information that is presented to you in words, sentences and paragraphs. It may be written or spoken, but the thought is expressed in words. Here you are required to interpret because many words have different meaning and you rely on the context to decide which is the correct meaning for this occasion. </p><p> &#9;The processing mode indices are calculated by combining all of the Figural activity scores, all the Symbolic activity scores, and all the Semantic activity scores.  Your results are presented in the graph below:</p><p ALIGN="CENTER">Content Abilities</p><FONT SIZE=2></FONT><img>
