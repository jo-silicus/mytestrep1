They can be analyzed individually and they can be grouped according to clusters.  The first analysis here is in terms of learning mode, which refers to the way an individual handles different types of content (or methods information is presented to us): Figural (Concrete), Symbolic (notational), and Semantic (verbal or written).  Content learning mode is especially important because it determines not only our preferred mode for learning or handling thinking types of situations,  but also, to a great extent, our preferences for career and other life-long decisions.  It offers students and teachers  indispensable information for understanding components of clusters of abilities involved in reading styles and as they affect reading performance.  Knowledge of intellectual learning modes allows for selecting appropriate methods and materials for teaching reading and mathematics.</P><P>Figural content deals with information that is presented in as close to real life as possible.  There is no interpretation, the recipient experiences the information.  Symbolic content is information that is presented in a coded fashion.  Symbols, that in and of themselves mean nothing, are presented in a context that conveys information.  Lastly, semantic content deals with information that is presented via word on concept approach.  On sees a word and immediately associates a concept or vice versa.</P><P>The learning mode indices are calculated by combining all of the Figural activity scores, all the Symbolic activity scores, and all the Semantic activity scores.  The results are presented in the graph below:</P><table width=640 cellpadding=0>  <tr>    <td width= 98></td>    <td colspan=9 width=538><p align=center><font color=#0000FF>Content</font></td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td width=98><font face=Arial size=1>Figural</font></td>    <td colspan=9 width=538><hr width=59.0 size=10 color=#000000 align=left noshade>    </td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td width=98><font face=Arial size=1>Symbolic</font></td>    <td colspan=9 width=538><hr width=104.75 size=10 color=#000000 align=left noshade>    </td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td width=98><font face=Arial size=1>Semantic</font></td>    <td colspan=9 width=538><hr width=83.4 size=10 color=#000000 align=left noshade>    </td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td colspan=10 width=638></td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td bgcolor=#008080 width=98><p align=left><font color=#FFFF00>Scale</font></td>    <td bgcolor=#008080 width=60><p align=right><font color=#FFFF00>1</font></td>    <td bgcolor=#008080 width=60><p align=right><font color=#FFFF00>2</font></td>    <td bgcolor=#008080 width=60><p align=right><font color=#FFFF00>3</font></td>    <td bgcolor=#008080 width=60><p align=right><font color=#FFFF00>4</font></td>    <td bgcolor=#008080 width=60><p align=right><font color=#FFFF00>5</font></td>    <td bgcolor=#008080 width=60><p align=right><font color=#FFFF00>6</font></td>    <td bgcolor=#008080 width=60><p align=right><font color=#FFFF00>7</font></td>    <td bgcolor=#008080 width=60><p align=right><font color=#FFFF00>8</font></td>    <td bgcolor=#008080 width=60><p align=right><font color=#FFFF00>9</font></td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td width=632 colspan=10>&nbsp;</td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td width=98></td>    <td bgcolor=#C0C0C0 colspan=3 align=center width=178><strong><font face=Arial    size=2>Undeveloped</font></strong></td>    <td bgcolor=#C0C0C0 colspan=3 align=center width=178><strong><font face=Arial    size=2>Expected</font></strong></td>    <td bgcolor=#C0C0C0 colspan=3 align=center width=178><strong><font face=Arial    size=2>Superior</font></strong></td>  </tr></table><P>This graph shows that this individual has a good balance between all three content areas.  Learning and processing of information should come easy to them because they can handle the information in virtually any manner it is presented.  Typically a person with this type of balance between contents will do well in group situations because they can adapt to whatever content the group is operating in.  They will also do well in progressing from teaching style to teaching style because they have the ability to adapt quickly to a new teacher or classroom.</P><P>Analyzing each content in depth shows this student's ability to deal with figural information is undeveloped.  In that most early schooling deals in the other two content areas primarily however, this under-development will not cause much of a problem in school.  This score would also indicate a lack of spatial awareness and orientation that may manifest in poor performance in athletics, crafts, perspective and balance.  Later as the student approaches the middle school and high school level, mathematics, which draws heavily on this content area, will be challenging and difficult. </P><P>The graph also shows that this individual is undeveloped in the symbolic content area.  Ability in this area means that one can gain information that is presented in a coded fashion.  The easiest analogy for this content area is to imagine a weathermap with all of its colors.  Each color is a <I>symbol or code</I> for a particular range of temperature.  In effect, one is gaining weather information, but from coded information.  This individual's undeveloped range ability in this area would indicate that they would probably not do well with a phonics approach to reading.  Further, numbers, arithmetic, and mathematics will be challenging until this content area is developed.  Music by sight, will not be a strong suit although music by ear is very possible. </P><P>This individual also indicates an undeveloped ability in the semantic content area. Semantic content deals with words, reading, writing, and vocabulary.  In essence, its the ability to deal  with language. This individual's ability would indicate a preference to other methods of learning and teaching.  The student probably has difficulty in reading, especially in comprehension and will more than likely, not have an affinity towards books and stories.  Writing will also be a labor in this student's eye.  In that most formal education deals heavily in this content area, it is especially important that emphasis be placed on developing this individual's ability in this area.  Otherwise, later education will be especially challenging and college education will be extremely difficult.</P><B><P ALIGN="CENTER">Learning or Understanding Abilities</P><P ALIGN="CENTER"></P></B><P>Mindcue measures five different processing abilities.  Three of the abilities (Cognition, Memory, and Problem Solving) are basic to any learning environment from the first day of Kindergarten to the last day of college, and even beyond as one enters the workplace.  </P><table width=640 cellpadding=0>  <tr>    <td width= 98></td>    <td colspan=9 width=538><p align=center><font color=#0000FF>School Learning </font></td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td width=98><font face=Arial size=1>Cognition</font></td>    <td colspan=9 width=538><hr width=181.0 size=10 color=#000000 align=left noshade>    </td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td width=98><font face=Arial size=1>Memory</font></td>    <td colspan=9 width=538><hr width=364.0 size=10 color=#000000 align=left noshade>    </td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td width=98><font face=Arial size=1>Convergent Production</font></td>    <td colspan=9 width=538><hr width=486.0 size=10 color=#000000 align=left noshade>    </td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td colspan=10 width=638></td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td bgcolor=#008080 width=98><p align=left><font color=#FFFF00>Scale</font></td>    <td bgcolor=#008080 width=60><p align=right><font color=#FFFF00>1</font></td>    <td bgcolor=#008080 width=60><p align=right><font color=#FFFF00>2</font></td>    <td bgcolor=#008080 width=60><p align=right><font color=#FFFF00>3</font></td>    <td bgcolor=#008080 width=60><p align=right><font color=#FFFF00>4</font></td>    <td bgcolor=#008080 width=60><p align=right><font color=#FFFF00>5</font></td>    <td bgcolor=#008080 width=60><p align=right><font color=#FFFF00>6</font></td>    <td bgcolor=#008080 width=60><p align=right><font color=#FFFF00>7</font></td>    <td bgcolor=#008080 width=60><p align=right><font color=#FFFF00>8</font></td>    <td bgcolor=#008080 width=60><p align=right><font color=#FFFF00>9</font></td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td width=632 colspan=10>&nbsp;</td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td width=98></td>    <td bgcolor=#C0C0C0 colspan=3 align=center width=178><strong><font face=Arial    size=2>Undeveloped</font></strong></td>    <td bgcolor=#C0C0C0 colspan=3 align=center width=178><strong><font face=Arial    size=2>Expected</font></strong></td>    <td bgcolor=#C0C0C0 colspan=3 align=center width=178><strong><font face=Arial    size=2>Superior</font></strong></td>  </tr></table><FONT SIZE=2><P>&#9;</FONT>This student’s cognition ability is under-developed and below the range one would expect for this level in school.  Generally, the student will be puzzled when they first encounter new information and may ask for instructions or the lesson to be repeated once or a number of times before they truly understand the concept.  Often students with this level of cognition will be helped by giving an example.  Hearing or seeing the issue first and then confirming with an example is often the way this student can understand.  If there is a possibility of hearing or sight problems, this student should be moved to the front of the class to enhance their ability to understand the information be presented.</P><FONT SIZE=2><P>&#9;</FONT>Analyzing this student’s performance on the assessment indicates that they are particularly attuned to detail.  Their ability to understand a single item or a single concept is far greater than their ability to take in a complex system of information.  Typically this is true of younger students where they will focus on a single unit as opposed to a more complex environment where the single unit is a part of an overall system.  Care should be taken to ensure this student’s lesson’s are clearly focused and not confused with many side issues or nuances.</P><FONT SIZE=2><P>&#9;</FONT>Analyzing this student’s performance on the assessment indicates that they have a good balance in dealing with both detail and the overall concept.  While they have a good eye for the detail and nuance, they still comprehend the individual units part in the over all system.  It is a pleasure to teach individuals of this nature because they have the ability to grasp the big picture as well as appreciate the smallest of detail.</P><FONT SIZE=2><P>&#9;</FONT>The memory score is a measure of the ability to receive new information, store it for later use, and then with a degree of precision, recall the information for current use.  The memory activities in the assessment force a delay in the student’s answer.  This delay avoids simple recall and measures the actual operation of memory.  The stimulus in these activities was given both visually and auditory so as to measure ability in both realms. This will give a good indication as to whether the student is a visual learner or an auditory learner.  The activities also work in both the unit complexity and the system complexity.</P><FONT SIZE=2><P>&#9;</FONT>This student’s memory is in the expected range and should serve the student well  in coping with the very high demands for memory in school, especially in the area of testing where recall of information is so important.  It is also important in learning arithmetic where remember of math facts and numerical relationships are such a basic part of understanding the more advanced concepts being taught.</P><FONT SIZE=2><P>&#9;</FONT>While memory of facts and information is important, the ability to use the information in relating other information and making useful implications upon the relationship is more important.  This student’s ability in this area is in the expected range.     The score indicates the student can not only remember information, but also recall and use the information when required.  This ability will be very useful for this student in school during the later years.</P><B><P ALIGN="CENTER">Problem-Solving</P><P ALIGN="CENTER"></P><P>&#9;</B>Problem solving deals with a student’s ability to collect information, correctly relate the various pieces of information, and converge upon an answer.  In strict SOI terms this was called <I>convergent production</I>.  It is a measure of the ability to logically come up with the solution to the problem the individual is facing.  In school work it is the ability to take the facts that one has memorized, bring them together in the correct process, and come up with the appropriate solution.</P><B><P>&#9;</B>This student’s ability in problem solving is very high, indicating a very logical mind.  The exercises given during this assessment show the student has a very structured approach to facing a problem and can carefully assemble the information needed to solve it.  This student will most likely do well with the numerical information where rules, formula, and structure are emphasized.  If the student has difficulty dealing with word problems, the fault lies in the ability to identify information rather than understanding how to solve the problem.</P><B><P ALIGN="CENTER">Reading Abilities</P></B><P ALIGN="CENTER"></P><P>&#9;The Mindcue Assessment Activities are often involved with acquiring and using reading skills.

Focus on the reading readiness and reading concept scores will reveal the difficulty.  Also look at semantic ability and any vision indicators that may reveal perceptual problems.</P><U><P ALIGN="CENTER"><BR>Reading Readiness</P><P ALIGN="CENTER"></P></U><P>&#9;Reading readiness is a combination of assessment results that looks at the basic abilities that underlie the ability to read.  First, one must see (more importantly, the brain must see) and we are looking at that ability. Next, one must have some concept of what a word is and how it is used.  Next, one must be able to see commonality – thing words and do words.  All of these abilities make up the score for reading readiness.</P><U><P><BR></U>&#9;The assessment results for this student indicate reading readiness is under developed and the student is probably having difficulty in learning to read or will be difficult to teach.  First, look at the content scores for proper alignment with teaching method – high symbolic = phonetic approach, high semantic = word association approach.  Next, carefully screen for visual perception problems.  If a vision indication has been triggered in the assessment, the child should be screened by a vision professional.  Lastly, look at classification scores.  If they are low, the student is having trouble organizing thoughts and associating words.  Drills in organization are in order to help the student identify common threads.</P><U><P ALIGN="CENTER"><BR>Reading Concept Use</P><P ALIGN="CENTER"></P></U><P>&#9;Reading Concept Use deals with the ability to read, understand, and apply what has been read to a learning or problem solving situation.  Reading comprehension is certainly a part of reading concept use, but it goes beyond that and measures the ability to relate written words, thoughts, and paragraphs.  It also considers reading speed and word recognition.  In essence, reading concept use measures how we use reading as an intellectual tool.</P><P>&#9;This student’s assessment shows they are under developed in reading concept use.  Typically this type of performance indicates the student has the abilility to recognize words and translate them into meaning and sounds, but does not digest the meaning.  Usually, they can read aloud quite well, but when asked what was meant by the passage or to recall facts about the reading passage, they are at a loss.  Look for low scores in ther cognition area.  Focus development on comprehension exercises.</P><U><P ALIGN="CENTER"><BR>
<B>Arithmetic and Mathematics</P>
</B><P ALIGN="CENTER"></P>
</U><P>&#9;The arithmetic portion of the assessment looks at an individual’s ability to deal with numbers, moving up and down a number line, the concept of zero and negative and positive numbers.  It also includes  the ability to relate numbers and recognize patterns and numerical systems.  When we add the spatial orientation portion of the assessment and the implication portions of the assessment, we show an individual’s readiness to deal with mathematical concepts, such as algebra and substitution.</P><U><P ALIGN="CENTER"><BR>Mathematics</P><P ALIGN="CENTER"></P></U><P>&#9;This student has rated as under developed in the area of mathematics.  This would indicate there is also under development also in the figural content.  If the figural content is in the expected range, suspect that the student has difficulty in understanding the concept of depth and dimension.  Encourage exercises where the student is required to show a third dimension in his work and appreciates the idea of perspective.</P>
<P>&#9;Introduction to algebra or geometry with this level of development will be extremely frustrating to the student and most likely lead to poor performance, loss of confidence and damage to self esteem.</P><B><U><P ALIGN="CENTER">Vision Indicators</P></B></U><P>During the assessment, this student’s vision was assessed from many different perspectives.  Naturally, the student has had their eyes tested in school or at home sometime during their life. This test was probably a test for visual acuity.  This assessment goes beyond that to assess the student’s perception, closure, and processing rates.</P><P>&#9;This student’s assessment indicates there are no vision problems.</P></BODY></HTML>
