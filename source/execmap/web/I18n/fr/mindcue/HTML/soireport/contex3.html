<p ALIGN="CENTER">The Five Thinking Operations</p>
</font></b><font FACE="Arial">

<p>The Structure of Intellect Model (SOI) defines five thinking operations, each of which
describes the operation of the mind on basic information. 

<dir>
  <b><p>Cognition</b> </font><score; type="skill" ; id="4"><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">Cognition is the most basic of
  thinking processes. It is known as &quot;comprehension&quot; and &quot;understanding&quot;
  and includes discovery, awareness, rediscovery, or recognition of information in various
  forms. High = Quick; one time learner.</font><font FACE="Arial"></p>
  <b><p>Memory</b></font><score; type="skill" ; id="5"><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">Memory is retention and retrieval of
  information in any form. It is one of the easiest to train of all the thinking abilities.
  High = Recalls everything well.</p>
  </font><font FACE="Arial"><b><p>Decision-Making</b> </font><score; type="skill" ; id="6"><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">Decision
  Making is critical thinking. It is deciding or judging correctness, suitability, adequacy,
  desirability, etc., of information. It assesses consistency and goal satisfaction. It is a
  thinking ability that is frequently overlooked in schools. High = Practical, manages time
  well.</p>
  </font><font FACE="Arial"><b><p>Problem Solving </b></font><score; type="skill" ; id="7"><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">Problem
  solving is also critical thinking. It synthesizes new information from given information,
  emphasizing what is conventionally accepted as the best answer or outcome. School work and
  business usually favor problem solving. High = Task oriented.</p>
  </font><font FACE="Arial"><p><b>Creativity</b></font><score; type="skill" ; id="8"><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">
  Creativity brings new information from given information, emphasizing the variety and
  originality of answers. Originality, flexibility, and fluency are important components of
  this ability. High = Innovative, fluent, humourous, high energy.</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">The Three Contents of Thinking</p>
</b></font>

<p><font FACE="Arial">The Structure of Intellect Model (SOI) also defines three formats of
thinking, each of which is a general variety of information. </font>

<dir>
  <b><p><font FACE="Arial">Figural </font></b><score; type="skill" ; id="1"><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">Figural
  information is the real thing. It is what we can see, hear, and touch directly. It may be
  a photo, a sound, or a gesture. It may be visual, auditory, or kinesthetic. This is a very
  important component for beginning learners. High = Good spatially, manipulates and figures
  mentally or manually. </p>
  </font><font FACE="Arial"><p><b>Symbolic </b></font><score; type="skill" ; id="2"><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">Symbolic
  information is in the form of symbols or signs. These are arbitrary marks that have no
  significance in or of themselves, but to which society has attached meaning. Examples
  include numeric and alphabetic characters, musical notes, and the various triangles,
  semicircles, etc., used on weather maps. The phonic approach to reading is symbolic
  content. High = Manipulates numbers or letters well; good with music.</p>
  </font><p><font FACE="Arial"><b>Semantic </b></font><score; type="skill" ; id="3"><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">Semantic
  information is found in the meaning that society attaches to words. It is either reading
  or writing, listening, or speaking. It tends to deal with the abstract. High = Good with
  words and ideas; express themselves well.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">The Six Products of Thinking</p>
</b></font><font FACE="Arial">

<p>The Structure of Intellect (SOI) model defines six products of thinking, each of which
is obtained through the intellect&#146;s processing of information.<b> 

<dir>
  <p>Units </b></font><score; type="skill" ; id="14"><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">A unit is a single item, such as one
  figure, one symbol, or one word. High = Good with details.</p>
  </font><font FACE="Arial"><b><p>Classes </b></font><score; type="skill" ; id="15"><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">Classes are
  sets of information units, grouped by common properties. High = Well organized. </p>
  </font><font FACE="Arial"><b><p>Relations </b></font><score; type="skill" ; id="16"><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">Relations
  are the connections that we recognize between units of information, based upon variables
  that link them. High = See connections.</p>
  </font><font FACE="Arial"><b><p>Systems </b></font><score; type="skill" ; id="17"><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">Systems are
  organized patterns of information items. They are arrangements of parts that interrelate
  or interact. Examples of systems include sequences of mathematical operations and the
  structure of language. High = Sees the big picture.</p>
  </font><font FACE="Arial"><b><p>Transformations </b></font><score; type="skill" ; id="18"><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">Transformations
  are changes to known information or its use. They require that the information be
  redefined or modified. High = Able to see varying points of view.</p>
  </font><font FACE="Arial"><b><p>Implications </b></font><score; type="skill" ; id="19"><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">Implications
  deal with cause and effect. They start with known information, then seek back to unknown
  causes or forward to unknown effects. High = Anticipates well</font><font SIZE="2">. </p>

<p>Stanine scores are a set of nine section where the distribution of a normal curve is
ranked for educational testing. These sections are sized so that the top section (Stanine
9) and the bottom section (Stanine 1) are 4% and the middle section (Stanine 5) is 20% and
all sections have a standard deviation of 2 and a mean of 5.</p>
