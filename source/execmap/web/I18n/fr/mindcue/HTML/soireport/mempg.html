<p><b>M**</b> is for Memory. This is the ability to commit information to storage for
exact retrieval. Memorization may be either a conscious or unconscious effort. And memory
itself is either short-term or long-term. Short-term memories come and go, as when a
person looks up a phone number and remembers it only long enough to dial it. In this
example, long-term memory is where that short-term memory is transferred after the brain
recognizes that same phone number is being frequently retrieved. The <b>M**</b> measure is
a composite of many different MindCue activities.</p>

<p>Stanine 6 and above show a rapid ability to recall facts. They often come to the
attention of instructors because they seem so knowledgeable. They tend to commit
everything to memory easily and without practice.</p>

<p>Stanine 3 and below need much practice before they store information. They may be
auditory or visual learners. High <b>MS*auditory</b></font><score;type="test";id="mssa"><font FACE="Arial">with low <b>MS*visual

a critical ability for architecture, construction, map making, etc.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Stanine 7 and above indicates the individual has an exception ability to remember the
interrelationships between parts of figural information. Geography, mechanical drawing,
engineering as well as weather forecasting and graphic designs are all areas where this
person would excel given the other abilities required for the task are in place. </p>

<p>Stanine 3 or below indicates the individual would have difficulty in remembering how
individual pieces of figural information fit together. Working with sequential tasks where
each task completed must be remembered and then reintroduced as a part of another, more
complicated task, would be challenging for this person. If <b>**S </b></font><score;type="skill";id="17"><font
