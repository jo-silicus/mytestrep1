<p></font><font FACE="Arial"><b>D** </b>is for <b>Divergent Production. </b>Sometimes
called creativity, this is the ability to generate, construct, or elaborate solutions
within the boundaries of a problem. Factors of one&#146;s <b>D**</b> score are <i>fluency</i>
(producing quickly and in volume), <i>variety</i> (producing in great diversity), <i>originality</i>
(producing what is beyond the conventional or expected), and <i>transformation</i>
(producing new uses for the known). In contrast to <b>N** </b></font><score; type="skill" ; id="7"><font FACE="Arial">,
the <b>D**</b> ability diverges from the known, out to the unknown. The <b>D** </b>measure
is accomplished by one activity.</p>

<p>Stanine 6 and above is most rare. High <b>D**</b> people are the creative ones in
society. They show humor, are flexible, original, and often quality conscious. Typically,
they have such high energy levels &#150; when working on tasks they like &#150; that they
become single-minded. High <b>D** </b>very flexible, so they become impatient with those
who are inflexible or intolerant of alternative work styles. They do not like routine
work. They are usually independent workers who see their own ways to work with data and
solve problems. They often will not work for supervisors who they think are unfair; in
school, they often will not work on subjects that they do not like.</p>

<p>Stanine 3 and below is not a disadvantage in the everyday world because the majority of
tasks do not depend on <b>D**</b> abilities. Low <b>D**</b> are usually not fluent
producers of many new or different ideas. They often have high anxiety levels when faced
with novel situations.</p>

<p>To achieve high scores in all areas of <b>D**</b> is extremely unexpected; few people
do so, although some do measure very high in at least one area. Often a high score in the<b>
D** </b>activity completed indicates a preference for that content area and forms an
indication of the area where the individual would succeed the most.</p>

<p>DFU </b>measures <b>Creativity </b>or <b>Divergent Production of Figural Units, </b>or
simply graphic creativity. <b>DFU</b> judges the ability to originate new graphic designs.

<p></font><font FACE="Arial">Stanine 7 and above indicates comfort with ambiguous tasks.
The person enjoys drawing sketches, designs, or graphs to express new ideas. The person
prefers to give and receive information in <b>*F*</b></font><score; type="skill" ; id="1"> <font FACE="Arial">format,
whether for school, business, or pleasure. </p>

<p><font FACE="Arial">Stanine 3 or below indicates a person who may appreciate *<b>F*</b> <score; type="skill" ; id="1">information,
but prefers it sequenced, symmetrical, patterned, determinate <b>- </b>in contrast to the
