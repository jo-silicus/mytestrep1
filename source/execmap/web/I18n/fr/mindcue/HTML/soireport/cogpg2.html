<p>Stanine 6 and above are rapid workers who catch on quickly. They work best at tasks
where there are many things to do, in a variety of ways; otherwise, they are prone to
boredom. Because they &quot;get it&quot; so quickly, they like fast-paced, changing tasks.
They may not wait to hear all of the information before interrupting or turning away to
&quot;get on with it&quot; <font FACE="Symbol">¾</font> which can make them seem
impulsive, or even rude, to people with lower cognition abilities. Without an equally high
<b>**U </b>ability, they will not enjoy working patiently with details. But with an
equally High **U ability, they can be extremely rapid workers and have very high
standards. Such people can be demanding supervisors, so they need to understand that
others may not be so quick to comprehend. High C** people who are perfectionists will also
