Unlike other IQ measures however,Mindcue does not seek to determine how smart an individual is, but carefully maps anindividuals thinking strengths and weaknesses so that they can be optimized in school, inbusiness or in the workplace.</p><p>Although, the Mindcue assessment considers the work of many authorities in the field,it is largely based upon the work of Dr. J. P. Guilford, Dr. Mary N. Meeker, and Dr.Robert J. Meeker. This work was called the <i>Structure of Intellect</i>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><table BORDER="2" WIDTH="590" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">  <tr>    <td VALIGN="TOP" colspan="3"><font SIZE="5"><i><b><p ALIGN="CENTER">The Structure of    Intellect Paradigm</b></i></font></td>  </tr>  <tr>    <td VALIGN="top"><font SIZE="5"><i><b>Operations </b></i></font><p><font SIZE="5">Cognition    <br>    Memory <br>    Decision Making <br>    Problem Solving <br>    Creativity </font></td>    <td VALIGN="TOP"><font SIZE="5"><i><b>Content</b></i></font><p><font SIZE="5">Figural<br>    Symbolic<br>    Semantic</font></td>    <td VALIGN="TOP"><font SIZE="5"><i><b>Products</b></i></font><p><font SIZE="5">Units<br>    Classes<br>    Relationships<br>    Systems<br>    Transformations<br>    Implications</font></td>  </tr></table><font SIZE="2"><p>&nbsp;</p>
