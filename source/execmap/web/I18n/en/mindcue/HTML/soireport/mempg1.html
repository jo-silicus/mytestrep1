<p><b>M**</b> is for Memory. This is the ability to commit information to storage for
exact retrieval. Memorization may be either a conscious or unconscious effort. And memory
itself is either short-term or long-term. Short-term memories come and go, as when a
person looks up a phone number and remembers it only long enough to dial it. In this
example, long-term memory is where that short-term memory is transferred after the brain
recognizes that same phone number is being frequently retrieved. The <b>M**</b> measure is
a composite of many different MindCue activities.</p>

<p>Stanine 6 and above show a rapid ability to recall facts. They often come to the
attention of instructors because they seem so knowledgeable. They tend to commit
everything to memory easily and without practice.</p>
</font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">

<p></font><font FACE="Arial">Stanine 3 and below need much practice before they store
information. They may be auditory or visual learners. Your assessment analyzed your visual
memory. If your <b>MS*v </b></font><score;type="test";id="mssv"><font FACE="Arial">is low, it may indicate that you are
an auditory processor. You would see an indication of this fact if you seem to work quite
well, but do not take very effective notes. In the field of business, this can be
devastating if you miss something that was said.</p>

a critical ability for architecture, construction, map making, etc.</p>

<p>Stanine 7 and above indicates the individual has an exception ability to remember the
interrelationships between parts of figural information. Geography, mechanical drawing,
engineering as well as weather forecasting and graphic designs are all areas where this
person would excel given the other abilities required for the task are in place. </p>

<p>Stanine 3 or below indicates the individual would have difficulty in remembering how
individual pieces of figural information fit together. Working with sequential tasks where
each task completed must be remembered and then reintroduced as a part of another, more
complicated task, would be challenging for this person. If <b>**S </b></font><score;type="skill";id="17"><font

concept of systems as opposed to one of memory. </p>
