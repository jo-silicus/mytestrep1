<B><U><p ALIGN="CENTER">Application Abilities</p></b></u><p> &#9;In addition to the school learning abilities that we have just considered, there are two other processing abilities.  Evaluation (decision making) and Creativity (in SOI terms it is called <I>Divergent Production</I>).  We call these &quot;application&quot; abilities because, while they are sometimes involved in school learning, evaluation and creativity are more often involved in applying the academic knowledge that has been learned.  The graph below is a display of your performance on these thinking abilities.</p><p> &nbsp;</p><B><p ALIGN="CENTER">Application Abilities</p><p ALIGN="CENTER"> <img> </p><p> &nbsp;</p><p> &nbsp;</p><p ALIGN="CENTER">Decision Making (<I>Evaluation)</p></B></I><p> &#9;Decision Making is one of the last abilities to fully develop.  This is why you may find yourself making choices or decisions that you regret almost as soon as you have made them.  The ability involves applying a rule set to choice.  When  faced with a choice, you collect the facts surrounding the choice and then apply a memorized rule or procedure to guide you in the evaluation of these facts.  People who score high in this area are normally in positions where decision making is required constantly.  They seem to be able to make up their minds rapidly.  People who are confused by choice, or who avoid situations where decision making is required, normally score low in this area.  Performance in this area reveals a great deal about how you will do given an objective test, where choice between true and false or multiple choice answers are required. If you are low in this area, you should try to take essay type tests where you can explain your thoughts.</p><B><p> &#9;&#9;&#9;</p><FONT SIZE=2></B></FONT><p> &nbsp;</p>
