<p> The graph also shows that you are somewhat undeveloped in the symbolic content area.  Ability in this area means that one can gain information that is presented in a coded fashion.  The easiest analogy for this content area is to imagine a weathermap with all of its colors.  Each color is a <I>symbol or code</I> for a particular range of temperature.  In effect, one is gaining weather information, but from coded information.  The fact that you have not yet developed this ability might indicate may have problems with learning numbers, arithmetic, and mathematics type information. If you are a musician, you probably found learning music by ear a great deal easier than learning by note.  As you progress further with your education, you will want to develop this area because it is important in many jobs such as engineering, accountancy, computer programming, etc.  It can be developed through various developmental exercises.  The time you spend in building this ability will be well worth the effort.</p>
