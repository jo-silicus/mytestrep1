<FONT SIZE=2><p> &#9;</FONT>Your assessment scores show that you may have difficulty handling material that is presented in symbolic or coded terms.  Arithmetic and music (by note) are prime examples of this type of learning, and you may have been having trouble with these subjects. The phonetic approach to reading is also an example of symbolic learning. If that is how you were taught to read, you probably found it very difficult because that is not your learning strength. When you encounter such material, ask the teacher to give you good examples and to explain the concept in detail.  This will help you understand better because  that approach is not so dependent on symbols. </p>
