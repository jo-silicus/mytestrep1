<B><p> &#9;</B>Your ability in problem solving is very high, indicating a very logical mind.  The exercises given during this assessment show you have a very structured approach to facing a problem, and that you can carefully assemble the information needed to solve it.  You will most likely do well with  numerical information where rules, formula, and structure are emphasized.  If you have difficulty dealing with word problems, the fault lies in the ability to identify information rather than in understanding how to solve the problem.</p>
