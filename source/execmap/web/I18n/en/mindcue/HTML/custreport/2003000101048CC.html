<B><p> &#9;</B>Further analysis of your ability in the problem solving area also shows you are well- under-developed in evaluation.  This also could be the reason you had trouble with the problem solving part of the assessment.  Poor evaluation lies in the inability to select the proper solution for the problem at hand.  You remember the facts correctly, but relate them incorrectly.  That results in an incorrect answer.  You might want to look at your memory scores also.</p>
