</b></u>&#9;Your assessment results indicate reading readiness is under developed.  You may be having difficulty in learning to read or do not read very well.  First, look for any vision indicator that may appear in this report.  If there are none, look at your content scores.  If you are high in symbolic, you should learn to read using a phonics approach.  Next, look at classification scores.  If they are low, you are having trouble organizing thoughts and associating words.  Drills in organization will help you identify common threads in things, and you will better understand how they relate to each other.</p>
