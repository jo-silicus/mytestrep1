<FONT SIZE=2><p> &#9;</FONT>The assessment shows your memory is in the under developed range and may be causing you problems in school, especially in  testing where recall of information is so important.  For this reason, you might ask your teachers for an alternative way to test your understanding of a subject.  Memory is also important in learning arithmetic where remembering math facts and numerical relationships is such a basic part of understanding the more advanced concepts being taught. Accordingly, if you are  having trouble in arithmetic, carefully check whether misunderstanding of the concept is at fault--or whether you just forget the facts learned earlier. Memory is the easiest ability to improve through exercise and drill. </p>
