<B><p ALIGN="CENTER">Content Abilities</p></B><p> Mindcue activities can be analyzed in a number of different ways.  They can be analyzed individually and they can be grouped according to clusters.  The first analysis here is in terms of learning mode, which refers to the way you handle different types of information: Figural (Material you can see, touch or experience), Symbolic (like musical notes or math signs and signals), and Semantic (words).  Content learning mode is especially important because it determines not only your preferred mode for learning or handling thinking types of situations.  They are also very important as you begin to select a future occupation.  These content scores give you valuable information for understanding how you work with various types of information:  what will be easy for you to learn and what will be harder for you to master. Selecting a job that matches with your strength would mean that you would most likely succeed in that type of work. </p><p> Figural content deals with information that is presented in as close to real life as possible.  You don't have to interpret what this information means, it is just there and you experience it.  Symbolic content is information that is presented in a coded fashion.  Symbols, that by themselves mean nothing,  take on a special meaning when assigned a subject.  It is like a + sign meaning to &quot;add&quot; when you are dealing with arithmetic.  Lastly, semantic content deals with information that is presented to you in words, sentences and paragraphs. It may be written or spoken, but the thought is expressed in words.</p><p> &#9;The learning mode indices are calculated by combining all of the Figural activity scores, all the Symbolic activity scores, and all the Semantic activity scores.
