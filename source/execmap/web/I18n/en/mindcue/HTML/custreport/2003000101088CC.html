<p> &#9;One particular thing that we have noted is that you are a quick study.  This means that you are fast to pick up a concept or idea and learn things rapidly.  This is important in jobs where there is  little supervision because it means that you can be shown how to perform a task and then be left alone to perfect the way you will accomplish it.  There is a down side, however, and you must realize that not everyone is this fast.  Remember to give people time to express themselves.  While you might quickly understand what someone is saying to you, don't cut them off.  Let them fully express their ideas.  Often they have worked  hard to present their idea, and being cut short is a  turn off.</p>
