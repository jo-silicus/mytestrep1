<FONT SIZE=2><p> &#9;</FONT>Your cognition ability is under-developed and below the range one would expect for your age or grade in school. This is not a reason to worry, but it could be an explanation should you be having difficulty in school.  All this means is that you need a little bit longer than most students to thoroughly understand the material being presented to you.  You need to hear the material being taught, and then you may want an example to confirm in your mind that you understand.  Don't worry about it. This is your learning style.  </p><p> If you need more information or another example, don't be afraid to ask.  Doing so will mean that you will understand and be able to perform the  task being taught. If you keep having difficulty, be sure to check for vision indicators on the assessment to see if there is any trouble there.  Also check your hearing.  If you have seeing or hearing problems, you need to  adjust where you sit in class and how you see what is presented.  As you look for  job opportunities, you may also want to avoid ones that require something to be learned immediately, or ones that  do not give an individual time to digest and study information.</p>
