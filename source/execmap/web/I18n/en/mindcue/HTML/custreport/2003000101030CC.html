<FONT SIZE=2><p> &#9;</FONT>The memory score is a measure of your ability to receive new information, store it for later use, and then (with a degree of precision) recall the information for current use.  The memory activities in the assessment forced a delay in your answer.  This delay avoided simple recall and measured the actual operation of memory.  The things you had to remember were given both visually and orally so we could measure ability in both areas. This will give a good indication as to whether you are a visual learner or an auditory learner.  </p>
