<p> &#9;During your assessment, many different scores indicated problems with vision and reading.  As the two are closely related in this assessment, it is difficult to determine the actual cause of the problem.  If you have always had problems with reading, and find that reading is  hard work, you might consider the possibility of dyslexia.  There are several organizations in your locality that do dyslexia screening and can help you get further information.  </P>
