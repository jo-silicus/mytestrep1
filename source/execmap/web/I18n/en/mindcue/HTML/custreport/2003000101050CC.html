<FONT SIZE=2><p> &#9;</FONT>Your scores indicate  high evaluation ability.  This would indicate that you are very confident in your ability to select the right course of action for any situation.  However, you might find yourself being too evaluative, meaning that you are always trying to select a specific choice, such as &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no,&quot; when in fact there may be a gray area or a &quot;maybe&quot;.  In school, your realm is the objective test where a mere selection from a list of possible answers is all you have to make.  Often you might find yourself to be quick to judgment and miss a better opportunity or answer that is later in the list.  So we caution you to be sure you  examine all possibilities before making your choice.</p>
