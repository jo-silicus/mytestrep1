<p> Word recognition, as represented by NST, is undeveloped.  You may be transforming letters or otherwise incorrectly processing symbols.  If so, you probably lose your place in reading, or, at least, you read slowly.  If you have difficulty finishing a reading passage, you may have fixation or saccades problems.  In general, this apparent problem with symbol processing may require monitoring by a vision professional, to determine if there are difficulties that would suggest vision therapy, treatment, etc.</p>
