Each SmartMod is designed to improve a specific thinking ability and together they form a program of exercise to improve your learning abilities.  Each of the prescribed Mods should be done no greater than three times per week for about 12 to 14 weeks.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just like physical exercise, the SmartMods start very easy and build in complexity.  You are encouraged to start at the beginning of each series and work your way to the end.  Don't worry if you don't finish or get some wrong answers.  The important thing is that you are doing the thinking, and that is what improves your ability.</p><p>Analyzing your assessment results yields the following recommendation for development.
